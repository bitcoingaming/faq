# What is bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a currency that is designed as an alternative to "fiat" currencies like the Dollar or Euro. It is decentraliced meaning there is no single entity controlling the currency or its monetary rules.
Bitcoin is a "Hard money", this means that it is a medium of exchange that is literally hard to produce, unlike fiat currencies.

Some people use bitcoin to claim their monetary sovereignty, others treat bitcoin as a speculative tool for growing wealth and some as a way of avoiding financial censorship from traditional payment channels.
We think that it is the future of money.
