# What is a "sat" or "sats"?

A "sat" is short for a "satoshi", a term derived from the first name of Satoshi Nakamoto, the presumed pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. It refers to the smallest fraction of a bitcoin that can be sent, which is 0.00000001. In other words, a full bitcoin is made up of 100,000,000 sats.
